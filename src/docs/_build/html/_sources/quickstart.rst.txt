ðŸš€ Quickstart 
==============

Installation
**************
PEGG is available through the python package index. To install, use pip: 

.. code-block:: python

   pip install pegg

Required Input Files
****************************
In order to use PEGG, you need at minimum 2 input files:

(1) A dataframe containing a list of input mutations

(2) A reference genome to work from.

An optional, but highly reccomended input file for use with the reference genome build GrCh37 is:

(3) chrom_dict, which provides on/off target scores for each protospacer occuring in exonic regions of GrCh37.

Reference files for (2) and (3), as well as a sample mutation dataset (1), are available at the following link:

- `Reference Files Dropbox Link <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h6fdvpv3tyny27q/AADYVOkJe12XZiD4pf3_WXuga?dl=0>`_

Reference File Formatting
**************************
PEGG requires that the reference files are in a specific format. This should be the only painful part of setting up your environment
to allow PEGG to generate pegRNAs. 

(1) Input mutations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First let's load in a dataframe containing a list of input mutations (1):

.. code-block:: python

   import pegg
   import pandas as pd
   import gzip
   from Bio import SeqIO
   #pandas, gzip, and Bio.SeqIO are required for parsing the reference files
   #they can be easily downloaded using 'pip install _____'

   #------(1) loading in input mutatations-------------
   filepath = '.../2020-06-16-MSK-IMPACT_EDITED.txt'
   mutant_input = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='\t')

The above codeblock shows how to load in the sample mutation input file available in the `dropbox of reference files <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h6fdvpv3tyny27q/AADYVOkJe12XZiD4pf3_WXuga?dl=0>`_.
To use **your own mutation input**, the input mutations follow the format shown in the dataframe below:

.. image:: mutant_input.png

Namely, 7 columns are required, providing information about the input mutations relative to the provided reference genome.
The input mutation dataframe **must match the column naming scheme shown above**:

1. Hugo_Symbol: the name of the gene within which the mutations falls. For non-coding locations, include some identifer.

2. Chromosome: which chromosome the mutation falls in. Use integers or 'X' and 'Y'.

3. Start_Position: start position of mutation in the reference genome (mutations should only be reported on the + strand)

4. End_Position: end position of mutation in the reference genome

5. Variant_Type: what type of mutation is it. Options: "SNP", "ONP", "INS", "DEL"

6. Reference_Allele: what is the reference allele. For insertions, this can be set to "-".

7. Tumor_Seq_Allele2: what is the mutant allele (i.e. what is the mutation sequence). For deletions, this can be set to "-".

(2) Reference Genome
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And now let's load in the reference genome. I suggest using the codeblock below if you're using GrCh37 as a reference file.
Otherwise, the format needs to be as follows:

- **records** = a list containing the chromosome sequences (preferably parsed by SeqIO).

- **index_list** = a list containing the indeces in **records** corresponding to chromosome 1-22, and chrX and chrY.

   - For example, **records[index_list[0]] should refer to chromosome 1** (numbering starts at 0, not 1 in index_list due to python conventions)
   - And **records[index_list[1]] should refer to chromosome 2**, etc.
   - For the X and Y chromosome, records[index_list[22]] should refer to chrX, and records[index_list[23]] should refer to chrY

In other words, **records** is a list containing the chromosome sequences, but likely also other unwanted sequences (alternate/unlocalized sequences), 
while **index_list** provides the indeces needed to place the chromosome sequences in records in order from chromosome 1-22, and chrX and chrY.

- An alternate way to format these input files is to have **records** list have the chromosome sequences in order from 1-22, chrX, and chrY, and set **index_list** = list(range(24))

See the following codeblock for how to set up **records** and **index_list** using the `provided reference genome file, GrCh37 <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h6fdvpv3tyny27q/AADYVOkJe12XZiD4pf3_WXuga?dl=0>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   #------(2) loading in reference genome GrCh37-------------
   file = '.../GRCh37/ncbi-genomes-2022-03-17/GCF_000001405.25_GRCh37.p13_genomic.fna.gz'

   #using gzip to load in the file...
   with gzip.open(file, "rt") as handle:
      records = list(SeqIO.parse(handle, "fasta")) #about 4 Gb in  memory
      #records = list that contains sequences split up by chromosome

   #filtering out alternative sequences to only select consensus chromosome sequences
   wrong = ["alternate", "unplaced", "unlocalized", "patch"]
   badlist = []
   for key in wrong:
      for i in records:
         ii = i.description
         if key in ii:
               badlist.append(ii)
               
   #creating an index for 
   index_list = []
   for idx, i in enumerate(records):
      ii = i.description
      if ii not in badlist:
         index_list.append(idx)

(3) On/Off Target scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The last reference file (3) is chrom_dict, which provides on/off target scores for protospacers in exonic regions of GrCh37.
These scores are used in the ranking and filtration of pegRNAs. Curently this is only available for GrCh37, but a chrom_dict reference file for
GrCh38 will be provided shortly and available in the `dropbox of reference files <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h6fdvpv3tyny27q/AADYVOkJe12XZiD4pf3_WXuga?dl=0>`_.

To import this reference file, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: python

   #---------loading in on/off-target efficiencies of sgRNAs in exonic regions of GrCh37---------------------
   file = '.../chrom_dict.pickle'
   chrom_dict = pd.read_pickle(file)

If you are using an alternative genome, or don't wish to use chrom_dict, set it equal to 'none':


.. code-block:: python

   chrom_dict = 'none'


Using PEGG
***********
Now that our reference files are loaded in, and PEGG is imported as a module, using PEGG is simple.


.. code-block:: python
   
   #specify which mutations within mutant_input to generate pegRNAs for
   #here we're going to just generate pegRNAs for 2 mutations, corresponding to row 422804 and row 16 of mutant_input
   mut_idx_list = [422804, 16] #alternatively, we can generate pegRNAs for the entire dataset = list(range(len(mutant_input)))
   PAM = 'NGG' #specify PAM sequence
   guides_per_mut = 5    #specify how many pegRNAs to return for each mutation
   RTT_lengths = [20,25,30] #specify RTT lengths and PBS lengths to generate pegRNAs for
   PBS_lengths = [5,7,10]
   minus_seqs = pegg.minus_seq_generator(records, index_list)

   #now generating the pegRNAs
   ranked_filtered_output = pegg.run(mutant_input, mut_idx_list, records, index_list, minus_seqs, chrom_dict, PAM, RTT_lengths, PBS_lengths, guides_per_mut)
   

Jupyter Notebook Tutorial
**************************
A jupyter notebook version of the PEGG tutorial can be accessed at the following link:

A Note on RAM
**************
Importing a reference genome into the local environment requires ~4 Gb of RAM. Chrom_dict is also a large file.
It's reccomended to use a machine with *at least*  16 Gb of RAM, though more is preferable, when running pegg.
